Kickstarter Project Analysis
The main aim of this project is to predict success or fail of Kickstarter campaign at launch time.
This project analyzed into 9 categories Theater, Technology, Publishing, Photography, Music, Journalism, Games, Food, and Film & Video and 40 subcategories. Only 53% campaigns reach their funding goals therefore the outcome is important before the launch of the project.
I used 4000 projects in my data sets with goal from $1.00 to $295,956,469.81. About 75% projects were successful for goal less than $1000 and 52% failed at goal of $45,000 - $50,000. From 4000 projects 53% were successful and 34% failed. I also analyzed which category performed better than the other. Based on the stats, Theater and Music seems to perform 38% and 25% better than other categories.
Location was another feature that was very interesting. I wanted to see whether certain location performed better than other location. The campaign was launched in #___ countries with 56% projects were successful in the United States. 
I also noticed that between April and June, there were more successful projects compare to other months. 
To be honest the datasets were lacking major information. First of all, I believe if we has regions, or zip codes, age group, average income, average house value etc.., we could get better picture and predict more accurate results. 
We could have created pivot tables that compares the percentage of successful vs failed projects. We could have also created graphs to see the average time it takes to reach the goal. 

Thank you,
